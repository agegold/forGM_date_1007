- Support single pedal driving (OP engage by curise main on switch "ON")
- Some lateral control tuning (updated)
- OP disengage conditioin : main on switch "OFF"

<b>Pedal Users:</b> Also note that you need to flash your Pedal to go to v0.5.10.  If you want to go back to 0.5.9 or 0.5.8 you need to flash your pedal back to 0.5.9.  Instructions are here:  https://medium.com/@jfrux/comma-pedal-updating-the-firmware-over-can-fa438a3cf910.  Also. After you flash your Pedal..  All hell will break loose on your dash.  Traction control error, Power Steering Error, Trailer Error, OMFG the sky is falling error etc.  DON'T PANIC.  Just drive around a bit and it will disappear after about 2-3 restarts of the car.  Don't rush it I believe it's time dependent as well.  Just drive as normal.  They'll go away.
